title: What did I do then ?

Project bug journal. 

What happened ? Why and how did I solve it. 

Taking the time to formalize what was learned from the mistake and prevent spending time on the same thing later

### In emulator : No public epoc

*what happened* : 
When starting the app in the android studio emulator, the public epoc section is empty

*why* :
the emulator has no internet access and can't access the list of public epoc published by Inria.

*what did i do to fix it* :
see here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50670547/android-studio-android-emulator-wifi-connected-with-no-internet
I decided to prioritize other things for now

*did it came back again* : not for now
